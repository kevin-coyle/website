    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>
      I am an experienced web designer and Acquia certified developer with over 7 years
experience in PHP (vanilla, symfony2 and laravel) and Drupal. I currently am quite
involved in DevOPs with a strong interest in automated testing and continuous integration.
I am a great team player but I also possess the ability to work well independently.
